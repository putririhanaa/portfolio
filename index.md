**Exponential Smoothing:** 
<div style="text-align: justify"> Exponential Smoothing is a time series method for forecasting univariate time series data. Time series methods work on the principle that a prediction is a weighted linear sum of past observations or lags. The Exponential Smoothing time series method works by assigning exponentially decreasing weights for past observations. It is called so because the weight assigned to each demand observation is exponentially decreased. These GUI tools can be helpful for exploring your data and understanding the results of Exponential Smoothing.</div>

### Detect Non-negative Airline Tweets: BERT for Sentiment Analysis

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>
