<div style="text-align: justify">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. With the help of data visualization, we can see how the data looks like and what kind of correlation is held by the attributes of data. It is the fastest way to see if the features correspond to the output. </div>

**Exponential Smoothing:** 
<div style="text-align: justify"> Exponential Smoothing is a time series method for forecasting univariate time series data. Time series methods work on the principle that a prediction is a weighted linear sum of past observations or lags. The Exponential Smoothing time series method works by assigning exponentially decreasing weights for past observations. It is called so because the weight assigned to each demand observation is exponentially decreased. These GUI tools can be helpful for exploring your data and understanding the results of Exponential Smoothing.</div>
